" ================ Indentation ======================
" === Considerations ===
" Using a 'tabstop' value other than the default (8 spaces), will result in
" your file having a different appearance when using tools such as cat (type
" on Windows), which can't use a custom width tab character. On the other
" hand, using hard tabs for indentation, allows others to view your code with
" the amount of indentation they prefer. Which of these considerations should
" have priority, is a matter of personal preference (and company policy).

" == Indents

filetype indent on

set autoindent  "When pressing enter, cursor goes below aligned with the start of the upper line
                "Does nothing more than copy the indentation from the previous
                " line, when starting a new line. It can be useful for
                " structured text files, or when you want to control most of
                " the indentation manually, without Vim interfering.
set smartindent "Automatically inserts one extra level of indentation in some cases, and works for C-like files

" == Tabs
set list listchars=tab:\ \ ,trail:Â· " Display tabs and trailing spaces visually

set smarttab      "Affects how <TAB> key presses are interpreted depending on where the cursor is.
                  "If 'smarttab' is on, a <TAB> key inserts indentation according to 'shiftwidth' at
                  " the beginning of the line, whereas 'tabstop' and 'softtabstop' are used elsewhere.
                  " There is seldom any need to set this option, unless it is necessary to use hard TAB characters in body text or code.

set shiftwidth=2  "Affects what happens when you press >>, << or ==. It also affects how automatic indentation works

set softtabstop=2 "Affects what happens when you press the <TAB> or <BS> keys. Its default value is the same as the value
                  " of 'tabstop', but when using indentation without hard tabs or mixed indentation, you want to set it tothe same value
                  " as 'shiftwidth'. If 'expandtab' is unset, and 'tabstop' is different from 'softtabstop', the <TAB> key
                  " will minimize the amount of spaces inserted by using multiples of TAB characters. For instance, if 'tabstop' is 8, and
                  " the amount of consecutive space inserted is 20, two TAB characters and four spaces will be used

set tabstop=2   "Changes the width of the TAB character, plain and simple

set expandtab   "Changes tabs for spaces
                "Affects what happens when you press the <TAB> key. If 'expandtab' is set, pressing the <TAB> key will always insert
